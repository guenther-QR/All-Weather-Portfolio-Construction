# Dynamic Portfolio Management and Macro Trading Research

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive study of optimized portfolio strategies across **11 asset classes over the past 50 years**. Using a **global macro framework**, the research uncovers key market regimes and provides actionable insights for building durable, risk-adjusted portfolios that can perform across economic cycles.

The study integrates portfolio optimization, macroeconomic analysis, and historical backtesting to guide the construction of resilient investment strategies.

## Key Contributions
- **50-Year Historical Analysis:** Optimized portfolios across major asset classes from 1970 to present.
- **Global Macro Lens:** Evaluation of asset returns in different macroeconomic environments, including inflation regimes and growth cycles.
- **Market Regime Identification:** Classification of historical periods based on asset class performance and macro indicators.
- **Custom All-Weather Portfolio:** Development of a diversified portfolio that consistently outperforms the traditional 60/40 portfolio especially in periods of financial distress.
- **Dynamic vs. Static Weights:** Comparison between period-specific optimized portfolios and a single robust static allocation.

## Methodology 
- Historical return data for 11 assets, including equities, bonds, commodities, and credit.
